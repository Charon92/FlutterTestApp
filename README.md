# A Flutter Test

A sample Flutter Project.

## What even is this?!

Literally just a giant test project so I can see what's possible with Dart and Flutter. As such, it 
is a _mess_ and most likely is poorly written but it has been an interesting experience. It'll likely
change a _lot_ as I mess about with it more.

Yes, I realise that it's imcomplete. Yes, I realise that it's poorly laid out. Yes, I realise that
I've made many _many_ mistakes. It's an early messing around app to get a feel for Dart/Flutter as a
 means for developing a mobile app. It was hacked together over a few days so it's going to be pretty 
gross.

### What if I want to clone this and use it/try it?

Well, you can! No promises of it working though. You'll need to create a `.env` file in the main 
directory and supply a value for `IMDB_MOVIE_API_KEY` which you can get from [here](https://imdb-api.com/api).
